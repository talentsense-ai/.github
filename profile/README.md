# TalentSense

**TalentSense** is an AI-powered recruiting assistant that compares a candidate's CV against a Job Description and returns a clear, actionable evaluation: an overall match score, skill breakdown, strengths, risks, and suggested interview questions.

> Built as a small, end-to-end SaaS: modern UI, clean API contracts, persisted history, and cloud-ready deployment.

---

## What it does

Given a Job Description and a Candidate CV, TalentSense generates:

- Overall Match Score (0-100)
- Skills breakdown (scored per skill, visualized)
- Strengths (what stands out)
- Risks or gaps (what to validate)
- Suggested interview questions (targeted and practical)

The goal is speed and consistency: evaluate candidates in seconds, with outputs you can act on.

## MVP experience

Core screens:

- Evaluate Candidate - input JD and CV and generate an evaluation
- Results - score, skills chart, and structured insights
- History - list previous evaluations
- Evaluation Detail - deep dive into a single evaluation

---

## Repositories

- talentsense-frontend - React + TypeScript (Vite), Tailwind, shadcn/ui
- talentsense-backend - FastAPI (Python), Pydantic validation, PostgreSQL persistence
- talentsense-infra - local dev environment (Docker), CI/CD notes, deployment scaffolding
- .github - org profile, templates, and community health files

---

## Tech stack

Frontend

- React + TypeScript + Vite
- TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
- TanStack Query
- React Hook Form + Zod
- Recharts

Backend

- Python 3.11+ with FastAPI
- Pydantic (strict validation)
- SQLAlchemy or SQLModel
- PostgreSQL
- OpenAI API (structured JSON outputs)

Infra

- Docker and Docker Compose (local dev)
- GitHub Actions (CI)
- Deploy targets: Vercel (frontend) and a container PaaS (backend) plus managed Postgres

---

## Principles

- Clear API contracts between frontend and backend
- Structured LLM output (JSON) validated before persistence
- Simple architecture (no microservices for MVP)
- Product-first UI: clean layout, sensible loading and error states, useful visuals

---

## Roadmap (high level)

MVP

- Evaluate, Results, History, Detail
- Persist evaluations in PostgreSQL
- Cloud deploy and a demo-ready UI

V2

- Auth (multi-user)
- Job templates
- Export (PDF)

V3

- Candidate comparisons
- Analytics dashboard
- Optional async processing for evaluations

## Contributing

This is an early-stage project. If you want to contribute:

- Open an issue with a clear description (expected behavior, current behavior, screenshots if applicable).
- Keep PRs small and focused.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.

---

## Status

In active development - building the MVP end to end.
